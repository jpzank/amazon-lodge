This quest for the pleasure of nourishing and providing meaningful moments has been constant since our ancestry. Today, this quest continues with countless products and producers. Thus was born the 'FARM TO TABLE' concept, which means bringing what comes from the earth to the table. This journey led me to an immersion in the Ecotone, between the Amazon and Cerrado, where I found an incredible place called Jardim da Amazônia, with a home kitchen led by a lady named CARMELITA ZANCHET.",

Fruits, seeds, vegetables, fish, and other delicacies I found in this Amazon/Cerrado fusion are undoubtedly the pursuit of my life project as a cook. I found a safe harbor, or 'safe kitchen'. Where will this journey take me? I'm still discovering, in no hurry to reach the end! Cooking is, above all, a great act of LOVE.",

The great value of monkey watching is observing free monkeys in nature, performing natural behaviors, with minimal human intervention,' explains Gustavo Canale, vice-president of the Brazilian Primatology Society.\n\nAccording to Canale, the name 'monkey watching' was inspired by another common practice worldwide, bird watching. 'In Brazil, bird watching has offered a great opportunity to observe monkeys too, because many bird watchers, when aiming their binoculars at the treetops, end up spotting capuchin monkeys, howler monkeys, spider monkeys, marmosets. For example, some of the best places to observe birds in the Amazon of Mato Grosso, Jardim da Amazônia and Cristalino Lodge, have already started organizing monkey watching programs in their tourist itineraries,' he says."
